# Rust-Space-Game
Made in Rust for an assignment for KTH course DD1337

The player (frog in spaceship) is controlled using the arrow keys. The player will move faster if you hold down the left shift key while moving.

Power-ups can be obtained by moving the player into them. They can be activated by pressing the key indicated above each power-up on the inventory HUD in the bottom left corner of the screen.
